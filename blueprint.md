# Blueprint: Dinner Menu Recommendation Site

## Project Overview
A modern web application that helps users decide what to eat for dinner. It provides random menu suggestions from various cuisines and keeps track of recently recommended dishes.

## Features
- **Menu Recommendation:** Randomly selects a delicious dinner menu from a curated list.
- **Recommendation History:** Displays the last few recommended menus.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive design with food-themed aesthetics and smooth transitions.
- **Theme Support:** Switch between Light (White) and Dark modes (persisted in localStorage).

## Technical Details
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ JavaScript.
- **Styling:** CSS variables for theming, Flexbox for layout.
- **Logic:** Array-based random selection for menus.
- **Storage:** `localStorage` for theme preference.

## Current Plan: Transition to Dinner Menu Site
1.  **UI Content Update:**
    *   Change titles from "로또 번호 추첨기" to "오늘의 저녁 메뉴 추천".
    *   Change button text from "번호 생성" to "메뉴 추천받기".
2.  **Logic Update:**
    *   Replace lotto number generation with a dinner menu list.
    *   Implement random menu selection logic.
3.  **Styling Adjustments:**
    *   Keep the dark/light mode support.
    *   Ensure the display container fits menu text instead of small circles.
4.  **Deployment:**
    *   Commit and push changes to GitHub.
